This repository contains a Python script that transforms an input image into a stunning pencil sketch using the power of computer vision and image manipulation
The script first reads the image in RGB format, converting it to a grayscale image to achieve a classic black and white effect. 
It then employs inversion techniques to enhance details and create an inverted grayscale image.
The final touch is the creation of a pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with an inverted blurry version.
This process is accomplished programmatically using the OpenCV library's divide function. 
Dive into the code to explore the magic of turning images into captivating pencil sketches!"
